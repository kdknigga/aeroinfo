                             (NAV-FILE)

INFORMATION EFFECTIVE DATE: 9/9/2021

    RECORD FORMAT: FIXED
    LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH: 805


FILE STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION:
--------------------------
    THERE ARE A VARIABLE NUMBER OF FIXED LENGTH RECORDS FOR
    A SINGLE NAVIGATIONAL AID (NAVAID). THE NUMBER OF RECORDS IS
    DETERMINED BY THE REMARKS, AIRSPACE FIXES, HOLDING PATTERNS, AND
    FAN MARKERS RELATED TO EACH NAVAID.
    THE RECORDS ARE IDENTIFIABLE BY A RECORD TYPE INDICATOR - (NAV1,
    NAV2, NAV3, NAV4, NAV5, NAV6), THE NAVAID FACILITY
    LOCATION IDENTIFIER, AND THE NAVAID FACILITY TYPE.

    EACH RECORD ENDS WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN CHARACTER AND LINE FEED
    CHARACTER (CR/LF). THIS LINE TERMINATOR IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE
    LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH.

    THE FILE IS SORTED BY STATE, CITY, NAVAID NAME, AND FACILITY
    LOCATION IDENTIFIER.


DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD TYPES:
-------------------------------
    THE 'NAV1' RECORD TYPE CONTAINS BASIC NAVAID INFORMATION.
    THERE IS ALWAYS A NAV1 RECORD.

    THE 'NAV2' RECORD WILL CONTAINS ONE 600 CHARACTER REMARK
    PERTAINING TO THE PRECEEDING NAV1 RECORD.

    THE 'NAV3' RECORD WILL CONTAIN THE COMPULSORY AND NON-COMPULSORY
    AIRSPACE FIXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRECEDING
    NAV1 RECORD.  THE RECORD IS PADDED TO ALLOW FOR A MAXIMUM
    OF 18 - 35 CHARACTER FIX ENTRIES.

    THE 'NAV4' RECORD TYPE CONTAINS THE HOLDING PATTERN ASSOCIATED
    WITH THE PRECEDING NAV1 RECORD. WHEN MORE THAN 9 HOLDING PATTERNS
    EXIST, TWO OR MORE NAV4 RECORDS ARE CREATED FOR ONE PRECEDING
    NAV1 RECORD.

    THE 'NAV5' RECORD TYPE CONTAINS THE FAN MARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH
    THE PRECEDING NAV1 RECORD.  THE RECORD IS PADDED TO ALLOW FOR A
    MAXIMUM OF 23 - 26 CHARACTER FAN MARKER ENTRIES.

    THE 'NAV6' RECORD TYPE CONTAINS THE CHECKPOINTS ASSOCIATED WITH
    THE PRECEDING NAV1 RECORD.

    EACH NAV1 RECORD MAY HAVE NONE, ONE OR MANY ASSOCIATED NAV2,
    NAV3, NAV4, NAV5 OR NAV6 RECORDS.  EACH NAV1, NAV2, NAV3, NAV4,
    NAV5, AND NAV6 RECORD CONTAINS THE BASIC NAVAID IDENTIFYING
    INFORMATION.

(NAVAID FACILITY LOCATION IDENTIFIER AND THE NAVAID FACILITY TYPE).

GENERAL INFORMATION:
-------------------
    1.  LEFT JUSTIFIED FIELDS HAVE TRAILING BLANKS
    2.  RIGHT JUSTIFIED FIELDS HAVE LEADING BLANKS
    3.  ELEMENT NUMBER IS FOR TERMINAL REFERENCE ONLY
        AND NOT IN THE RECORD.
    4.  THE UNIQUE NAV ID (ELEMENT NUMBER: DLID) IS MADE UP OF
        THE FACILITY IDENT, THE FACILITY TYPE CODE, AND THE CITY.
    5.  LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE INFORMATION IS REPRESENTED
        IN TWO WAYS:
        A.  FORMATTED:
           -----------
            LATITUDE     DD-MM-SS.SSSH
            LONGITUDE    DDD-MM-SS.SSSH

        WHERE:           DD IS DEGREES
                         MM IS MINUTES
                         SS.SSS IS SECONDS
                         H IS DECLINATION
            EXAMPLE:     LAT-    39-06-51.070N
                         LONG-   075-27-54.660W

        B.  IN ALL SECONDS :
            ----------------
            LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE       SSSSSS.SSSH
            WHERE    SSSSSS.SSS IS THE DEG/MIN/SEC CONVERTED
                     TO ALL SECONDS
                     H IS THE DECLINATION

            EXAMPLE: LAT-     140811.070N
                     LONG-    27164.66W
